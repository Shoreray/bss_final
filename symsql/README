1. Test cases for Python-SQL
test_python_sql_0[1-6].py

2. Test cases for self-crafted python SQL library
test_python_mysql_0[1-2].py

3. Self-crafted python SQL library
mysql.py

4. How to run
simply run the testing python script (e.g., python test_python_mysql_01.py)

5. Possible issue
You may need to build your own libz3str.so to run the test cases successfully.
Please refer to https://sites.google.com/site/z3strsolver/getting-started for 
more details on how to build libz3str.so. libz3str.so should be place in symex 
directory.
